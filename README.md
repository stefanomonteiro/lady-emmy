So far the website has 4 sections. Some minor details I will still be fixing later on.

1 - Navigation Menu: We have discussed about it. However, if anything should still be changed please let me know.

2 - Banner Section: I have only placed an image as a placeholder to speed up full the mock up. My idea is to make images and texts appear independently from each other. Ie. one can fade in, the other slide from the left, etc.

3 - Newsletter Section: I will still add hover effect on the button, and some effect when the input box is active. These will improve the user experience. As the layout goes I am happy, unless you'd like to add something.

4 - The Who Is section: I have created three different options. I will still add some subtle effects and some minor adjustments still needed.

    4.1 - [All Gold](https://stefanomonteiro.github.io/lady-emmy/whois_gold/){:target="\_blank"}

    4.2 - [Purple Background](https://stefanomonteiro.github.io/lady-emmy/whois_purple/){:target="\_blank"}

    4.3 - [One Frame](https://stefanomonteiro.github.io/lady-emmy/whois_one/){:target="\_blank"}
        Two things I would like you opnion here:
            - The 'piramid effect';
            - Having the image and the text in the same frame.
